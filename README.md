# ðŸ§  XAI Study Plan

This repository is my personal workspace for learning and practicing **Explainable AI (XAI)**.  
It helps organize study tasks, summarize papers in plain language, and collect small code examples of XAI methods.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goals
- Keep a **clear study plan** with tasks and deadlines.
- Write **one-page paper reviews** in plain language.
- Collect **hands-on demos** of common XAI techniques:
  - SHAP
  - LIME
  - Grad-CAM
  - Integrated Gradients
- Track learning progress in a simple and reproducible way.
